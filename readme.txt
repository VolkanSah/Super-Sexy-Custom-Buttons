This plugin targets the "Continue Reading" links, and the "Post Comment" and "Reply" buttons in your comment sections. These are the most important buttons, and now theyâ€™ll look better than ever!

= Can I use this for other buttons? =
The plugin is designed to focus on those key buttons, but if youâ€™re feeling adventurous, you can always add the `.fancy-button` class to any other button you want to glam up.
